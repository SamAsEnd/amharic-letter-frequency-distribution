\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, anyone can use this results to break an Amharic plain text encrypted with cryptographic algorithms which don't adequately hide the language statistical distribution of the letters. These findings should also be used to develop an efficient keyboard layout which is optimized for speed, number of required key combination and hand movements. The results will also be valuable for researchers and experts developing an Amharic optical character recognition software using this data to prioritize and optimize their algorithm to the most frequent letters. They can also predict when challenged using this result. The possibility is innumerable to use this knowledge, I hope it will be useful for all who finds it.
